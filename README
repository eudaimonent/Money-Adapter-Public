OpenSim Money Adapter Module
============================


Compiling the Module
--------------------

Copy the MoneyAdapter directory into the OpenSim addon-modules folder and compile
OpenSim as usual.


Runtime Module Installation
---------------------------

If you just want to install the runtime module without having to compile it yourself,
simply copy the MoneyAdapter/Modules/bin/Debug/MoneyAdapter.dll file into the OpenSim
bin folder.


Configuration File
------------------

Copy the [Money Adapter] section of the OpenSim.ini.include file into your
bin/OpenSim.ini file and modify the other sections as shown. Adjust the settings
to your needs. Especially adjust all URIs, passwords and user UUIDs.


Database Setup
--------------

Create the new MySQL database for the money server and then initialize the database
by executing this command:
  mysql -u<name> -p<password> <database> < database/money_v2.sql


Web Site Setup
--------------

Copy the "money" directory in the webroot folder into your root HTTP or HTTP-S
folder of your web server. After that set the ownership and permissions of all
files correctly and adjust the settings in the config.php file. 

Be sure that you have installed PHP and configured MySQL such that it can execute
PHP scripts installed in that web folder.


Currency Symbol
---------------

If you want to be able to change the currency symbol, you have to apply the
Currency.patch to your OpenSim source code:
  - go to your OpenSim source folder
  - copy the Currency.patch file into that folder
  - execute "patch -p1 < Currency.patch"

After that specify the currency symbol (up to 3 characters) as "Currency"
setting in the [LoginService] section of the StandaloneCommons.ini or
Robust.ini files.
